## The five design principles

Each is borrowed from fifty-year-old, still-standing engineering practice:

1. **One stage, one job** (Unix / Parnas). Each stage handles a single step and writes to its own folder. A stage that fetches does not also filter; a stage that filters does not also format.
2. **Plain text as the interface** (Kernighan & Pike). Stages communicate through markdown and JSON. No binary formats, no databases in the loop, no proprietary serialization. Any human with a text editor can inspect or modify any artifact.
3. **Layered context loading.** Agents load only what the current stage needs — prevention, not compression. Within content, reference material (internalize as constraints) is kept structurally separate from working artifacts (process as input), because they ask different things of the model.
4. **Every output is an edit surface** (Horvitz / Shneiderman). Each intermediate output is a file a human can open, edit, and save before the next stage runs. The next stage reads whatever the human left there.
5. **Configure the factory, not the product** (continuous delivery). Set up preferences, brand, style, and structure once; every run emits a new deliverable from the same configuration.

The consequence, stated once: *stage sequencing is the folder numbering; context scoping is the folder hierarchy; state management is the files on disk; coordination is one folder's output being another folder's input.* The filesystem does the work a framework would do in code.

## The five-layer context hierarchy

| Layer | Typical file | Question it answers | Role | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | `workspace.md` (via `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`GEMINI.md` stubs) | Where am I? | routing | 300–800 tokens |
| L1 | root `CONTEXT.md` | Where do I go? | routing | 200–500 tokens |
| L2 | stage `CONTEXT.md` | What do I do? | **the control point** | 200–500 tokens |
| L3 | `references/`, `_shared/` | What rules apply? | factory (stable) | 500–2k tokens |
| L4 | `output/`, run artifacts | What am I working with? | product (per-run) | varies |

- L0–L2 are the catalog: small, stable, no content payload.
- L2 is the control surface of the whole system — its Inputs section is what makes context selection explicit, editable, and auditable instead of left to agent judgment.
- L3 vs L4 is the factory/product split. L3 = the recipe (voice.md, design-system.md, schema.md). L4 = the ingredients and the dish (research-output.md, draft.md).
- Large L3 collections get their own internal `CONTEXT.md` router — the L1 routing pattern applied recursively. The hierarchy is self-similar at every depth; apply it inside any folder that grows past easy scanning.

## Stage contract format

Every working folder carries a `CONTEXT.md` shaped like this (copy from `assets/templates/stage-CONTEXT.md`):

```markdown
# 02_script — turn research into a script

One job: write the script from the research output.

## Inputs
- Working (this run): ../01_research/output/research.md
- Reference (every run): ../../_shared/voice.md
- Reference (every run): references/structure.md

## Process
1. Read the research output.
2. Draft to the structure in structure.md, in the tone of voice.md.
3. Keep under 90 seconds spoken.

## Outputs
- script_draft.md → output/

## Human check
Read the draft aloud. Verify the argument order survived from research. Edit in place; the next stage reads whatever is here.
```

Rules: inputs are exact paths, split working vs reference. The process is numbered and short — constraints live in L3 files, not restated here. Exactly one human check, stated as something a person does, not a vague "review."

## Naming conventions

- Stage folders: `NN_kebab-name` (`01_research`). Ordinal-only prefixes (`00-tracker.md`) for ordered files inside a folder.
- Meta/system folders get an underscore prefix and sort to the top: `_meta/`, `_system/`, `_shared/`, `_config/`, `_templates/`, `_index/`, `_archive/`. Underscore = "about the workspace, not of the work."
- Records and nodes: kebab-case slugs for machine-facing files, or human-readable Title Case where a person browses daily (an Obsidian vault). Pick one per workspace and write the choice into the schema — drift between schema and files is the most common decay.
- Typed content files may prefix their type: `data-customer-list.md`.
- Entry files: hub-and-spoke. `workspace.md` is the single hand-maintained L0 home (identity, map, routing). Each tool's auto-load filename — `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code), `AGENTS.md` (Codex and most agents), `GEMINI.md` (Gemini) — is a thin generated stub that says "Read `workspace.md` now before doing any work" and nothing else. Never hand-edit a stub; never let one carry content; regenerate all of them together when the workspace name changes. This is what keeps a multi-model setup (different executors dispatched by an orchestrator) converging on one source of truth instead of drifting into N copies of the instructions.
- Templates are blank, named for what they produce, and live together: `_templates/pilot-brief.md`.

## Library rules

- **The catalog holds no books.** Routing files point at everything and store almost nothing. When a routing file grows, it is absorbing payload — move the payload to a shelf.
- **One home per fact; a link beats a copy.** Duplication is how structures rot.
- **Generated indexes are never hand-edited.** A file map built from frontmatter by a script cannot drift; a hand-curated one always does. If an index matters, script it and schedule the rebuild.
- **The structure is the documentation.** If something needs explaining, the explanation goes in that folder's `CONTEXT.md`, not in a wiki elsewhere and not in anyone's head. A new collaborator should understand the whole pipeline by reading the CONTEXT files top to bottom, without running anything.
- **Method and instance live apart.** The blank, reusable template of a structure is a different artifact from any filled-in deployment of it. When a structure proves out, extract the template before it tangles with the data.
- **Working sessions end in artifacts.** A workshop, interview, or planning call that produces only slides or vibes has failed the structure; it should end with files the structure can shelve.

## Token discipline

A stage's full context — entry + contract + references + inputs — should land around 2,000–8,000 tokens. That keeps the model in the range where it performs best and keeps every load auditable. A monolithic everything-prompt for the same pipeline typically runs 30k–50k tokens, most of it irrelevant to the current step; ICM never loads those tokens rather than compressing them later. If a stage's context balloons: split the stage, tighten the Inputs list, or push detail down into an L3 file the contract points at but doesn't inline.

## Where ICM loses

Name these honestly rather than overclaiming:

- **Real-time multi-agent collaboration** — agents responding to each other in tight loops need message-passing infrastructure; file handoffs are too slow.
- **High concurrency** — many users hitting one pipeline needs queueing, state isolation, deployment. ICM is local-first by design.
- **Automated mid-pipeline branching** — a human choosing stage 3a vs 3b between stages is natural; the *system* branching on AI output mid-run pushes ICM toward becoming the framework it replaced.

The claim is not that ICM replaces frameworks everywhere. The claim is that for sequential, human-reviewed, repeatable workflows — most knowledge work — the framework is more complexity than the problem requires, and that complexity costs opacity, fragility, and developer dependency.
